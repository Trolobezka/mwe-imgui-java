# Minimal working examples for ImGui (Windows, Java, Gradle, LWJGL, OpenGL)

* `mwe-application` is using the application layer from `imgui-app`.
* `mwe-binding` is using the bindings with custom window creation (GLFW from LWJGL).

Both Gradle projects were generated with default settings by following this [guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_building_java_applications.html) in Gradle docs.

Runnable `.jar`s can be created with the help of [Shadow](https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/getting-started/).
